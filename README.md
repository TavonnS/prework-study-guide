# Prework Study Guide README

## Description
This project served as a hand-on introduction to several of the technologies that will be learned and used in this Coding Bootcamp.  It was a way to gain experience with Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as using a Command Line Interface.  The project is also a quick summary and record of the prework topics that can be referenced later, and a simple first page to add to my GitHub portfolio.

## Usage
This study guide can be used as a reference on the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and GitHub. The guide page can be inspected using DevTools to reveal the JavaScript.  Or, it may simply be looked over as a quick record of the first bootcamp project.
